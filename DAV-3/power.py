Imagine you are a quality control manager at a chocolate factory. You're responsible for 
ensuring that the average weight of chocolate bars produced in your factory meets a certain 

standard.

The standard weight of a chocolate bar is 50 grams, and it rarely deviates, 
with a known population standard deviation of 2 grams.


To maintain the quality of your chocolate bars, you collect a sample of 30 bars every day 
and weigh them.

You want to know if your production process is still on track and that the average weight of 
the chocolate bars is 50 grams.

You set the significance level (Î±) to 0.05, and you want to calculate the power of your quality 
control test.
