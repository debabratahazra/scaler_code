Sun Pharmaceutical Industries claims that a person's IQ improves after they use the Donepezil drug.

To test this claim a trial was conducted considering 20 patients. An IQ test was conducted for these patients before giving the drug and an IQ test was conducted for the same set of patients after the drug the recorded results are shown below.

IQ_before=[101,124,89,57,135,98,69,105,114,106,97,121,93,116,102,71,88,108,144,99]

IQ_after=[113,127,89,70,127,104,69,127,115,99,104,120,95,129,106,71,94,112,154,96]
Perform an appropriate test to test the claim at 90% confidence.
