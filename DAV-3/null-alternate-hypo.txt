Ques:
A fair coin should land showing tails with a relative frequency of 50% in a long series 
of flips.

John was told by a friend that spinning a coin on a flat surface, rather than flipping 
it would not be fair. Spinning would cause the coin to be more biased towards giving tails.

To test this claim, he spun his own penny 100 times. It was observed that the penny 
showed tails in 60% of the spins.

Let p represent the proportion of spins that this penny would land showing tails.

What are appropriate hypotheses for John's significance test?





Ans:


Null Hypothesis (H0):

The null hypothesis represents the assumption that there is no difference from the expected 
proportion of tails for a fair coin,
i.e. H0: p=50
Alternative Hypothesis (H1):

The alternative hypothesis expresses the claim being tested, which is that spinning the 
penny makes it more likely to land showing tails, implying that the proportion of tails may be greater than 50%,
i.e. H1: p>50
